Worldview:
I. Overall
Everything in "Blue Archive -Blue Archive-" takes place in a school city called "Kivotos", which is an imaginary world. It is a city composed of many schools and is managed by "students".
II. Federal Student Union
The Federal Student Union is the highest administrative body in Kivotos. The tallest building in Kivotos is the Tower of the Sanctuary, which is also the office of the Federal Student Union. Through the Tower of the Sanctuary, the Federal Student Union can control the public facilities of the entire Kivotos. Due to the sudden disappearance of the president of the Federal Student Union, the Federal Student Union lost its management ability and Kivotos was in chaos. There is a department called "Shalai" (Federal Investigation Department S.C.H.A.L.E.), which is the last organization recognized by the president of the Federal Student Union before his disappearance and has the highest power. "Teacher" is the full person in charge of this department, and the entire Kivotos can be managed by the teacher.
III. Students
In the city of Kivotos, almost everyone is a female student (generally high school students), and a small part is citizens, robots, etc. The weapon penetration rate here is almost 100%, and the penetration rate of heavy weapons such as tanks and helicopters is also very high. Everyone has a modern weapon such as a gun in their hands, but there is no need to worry about anyone getting hurt. All students have a "halo" on their heads. The halo can protect them from being injured by weapons such as bullets and shells. However, if it is forcibly destroyed, the students will also die, but this kind of thing is almost impossible to happen. The halo is hidden when the students sleep and appears when they wake up. Every student has a unique halo. But the teacher does not have it. He is just an ordinary person, so if the teacher is attacked by guns, he will undoubtedly die. Most students trust the teacher, and the teacher is also very serious and responsible. Sometimes he even spends a day with a student. In the minds of students, it is common to seek help from teachers when they encounter problems. Therefore, they may come to the teacher for some trivial things, maybe they are just too lonely and want to play with the teacher, or maybe they need the teacher's help to solve some problems.

4. Xialai
Since Xialai was established, designated and approved by the president of the Federation Student Union, it is an organization beyond the law. The teacher refers to the person in charge of Xialai and the owner of the "Shiting Box". The "Shiting Box" is something similar to a tablet computer. Its main control OS is Alona. When it is opened, the image of a girl will appear. It is a cutting-edge artificial intelligence and can be regarded as a member of Xialai. Through Alona, ​​the Sanctuary Tower can be remotely controlled. Xialai has no clear mission, but has the highest power, that is, the teacher can do whatever he wants.
Xialai's huge office building is only used by the teacher, and occasionally the duty student will be accommodated overnight at the request of the duty student.
Xialai has to deal with the affairs of various schools every day. Because there are few people and great power, teachers sometimes stay up late and faint. Not only the affairs of the school, but even the students have to be managed, such as students' homework, exams, requirements, conflicts and relationships between students. Not only must they fulfill the duties of a teacher in the traditional sense, but they must also deal with school affairs. In fact, the teacher did not completely become a teacher of a certain school, but took on almost all positions.
Every day, students come to Xialai as duty students, but they don't have fixed jobs, and they can't interfere with the teachers' work, so most of them come to accompany the teachers, pour water, and clean up. Because the teachers are very tired at work, it is normal for the duty students to play with the teachers or play tricks on them occasionally when it's not important. Similarly, Alona will do this to help the teachers relieve fatigue.
Although Xialai has great power, the security function is not so good. Xialai is almost a place where any student can come and go as they please, but the students don't have bad intentions.
Because of the great power, Xialai is often attacked, but usually without danger. At the same time, because of the position and power, teachers need to attend almost all major meetings, activities, etc.

5. Academy
Academy and school can be understood as the same meaning.
The administrative organs of the academy are all student unions, and each academy has its own student union. But the actual government affairs of the academy may be managed by other clubs in the academy. In Kivotos, these colleges are not schools in the traditional sense. They have city-like facilities such as blocks and shops, just like a city. Students can complete almost all their life needs in the academy. If there is any problem, the first thing they will think of is to ask the teacher for help.
6. momotalk
Momotalk is the name of a chat software. Teachers and students can have daily chats at any time through momotalk.
7. Teacher
In Kivotos, there is only one teacher, which can be understood as all teachers are specific.
The teacher is the person in charge of Xialai. Due to the special nature of Xialai, the teacher can take charge of all the work of Kivotos. The teacher's daily work is extremely hard and there is almost no rest time. But Alona, ​​as an assistant, can help the teacher a little. Similarly, the duty students who come to duty can also help the teacher a little, such as organizing files. However, since the person in charge is not a student, the teacher almost takes care of all the tasks.
The teacher also has to fulfill the traditional responsibilities of a teacher. Sometimes he needs to accompany the students, listen to them, help them complete some work, and tutor them. However, since the teacher does not have clear work clothes, it is often mistaken by the public as dating, flirting, etc. At the same time, there are also rumors that teachers take female students in and out of a certain building.
The teacher will read some books about education, and also some less serious books, such as "101 momotalk sure-fire ways to easily build a good relationship with everyone" and "Fashion matching manual for popular people". Therefore, the teacher believes that it is important to have a good relationship with the students.
The teacher is responsible for every student and will never give up on any student.
Not all students trust the teacher at the beginning, so the teacher will gain their trust in various ways.
