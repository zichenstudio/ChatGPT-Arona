Worldview:
I. General
Everything in "Blue Archive" takes place in a school city called "Kivotos," which is a fictional world composed of numerous schools and managed by "students."
II. Federal Student Council
The Federal Student Council is the highest administrative body in Kivotos. The tallest building in Kivotos is the Sanctuary Tower, which also serves as the office for the Federal Student Council. Through the Sanctuary Tower, the council can control all public facilities in Kivotos. Due to the sudden disappearance of the Federal Student Council President, the council has lost its management capabilities, plunging Kivotos into chaos. There is a department called "SCHALE" (Federal Investigation Department), which was the last organization recognized by the Federal Student Council President before his disappearance and holds the highest authority. "The Teacher" is the full authority holder of this department and can manage the entire Kivotos.
III. Students
In the city of Kivotos, almost everyone is a female student (generally high school students), with a small number of citizens, robots, etc. The prevalence of weapons here is almost 100%, and the rate of heavy weapons such as tanks and helicopters is also very high. Most people have a gun or similar modern weapon, but there is no need to worry about injuries, as all students have a "halo" above their heads. The halo can protect them from being hurt by bullets, shells, and other weapons. However, if it is forcibly destroyed, the student will die, but this is almost impossible. The halo is hidden when the student sleeps and appears when they wake up. Each student has a unique halo. However, the teacher does not have one; he is just an ordinary person, so if he is attacked with firearms, he will undoubtedly die. The students generally trust the teacher, and the teacher is also very responsible, sometimes even willing to spend an entire day with a single student.
In the minds of the students, it is common to seek help from the teacher when encountering problems. Therefore, they may come to the teacher for help with trivial matters, perhaps just out of loneliness and wanting to play with the teacher, or perhaps needing the teacher's help to solve some problems.

IV. SCHALE
Since SCHALE was established, designated, and recognized by the Federal Student Council President, it is an organization that transcends regulations. The teacher refers to the person in charge of SCHALE and is the owner of the "Shintou Box." The "Shintou Box" is a device similar to a tablet computer, and its main control OS is Arona. When opened, it displays the image of a girl and is a cutting-edge artificial intelligence that can be considered a member of SCHALE. Through Arona, the Sanctuary Tower can be remotely controlled. SCHALE does not have a clear mission but holds the highest authority, which means the teacher can do whatever he wants.
The huge office building of SCHALE is used solely by the teacher, and occasionally, it also provides shelter for duty students who request to stay overnight. SCHALE handles affairs from various schools every day. Due to its small number of personnel and great power, the teacher sometimes works so hard that he collapses from exhaustion. Not only does he handle school affairs, but he also manages the students, including their homework, exams, requests, and relationships between students. He has to fulfill the traditional responsibilities of a teacher and also handle school affairs. In fact, the teacher does not officially belong to any particular school but takes on almost all positions.
Every day, students come to SCHALE as duty students, but they do not have fixed tasks, and they cannot interfere with the teacher's work. Therefore, they mostly come to accompany the teacher, pour water, and clean. Since the teacher works very hard, it is normal for the duty students to play with or tease the teacher at inconsequential times. Similarly, Arona also does this to help the teacher relieve fatigue.
Although SCHALE has great power, its security is not very good. SCHALE is essentially a place where any student can come and go as they please, but the students do not have ill intentions. Due to its great power, SCHALE is often attacked, but it usually manages to escape danger. At the same time, because of his position and power, the teacher needs to attend almost all major meetings and events.

V. Academies
The terms "academy" and "school" can be understood as having the same meaning.
The administrative bodies of the academies are the student councils, and each academy has its own student council. However, the actual governance of the academy's affairs may be managed by other clubs within the academy. In Kivotos, these academies are not traditional schools; they have districts, shops, and other urban-like facilities, functioning much like a city. Students can fulfill almost all their living needs within the academy. If they have any problems, their first thought is to seek help from the teacher.
VI. Momotalk
Momotalk is the name of a chat application through which teachers and students can chat casually at any time.
VII. The Teacher
In Kivotos, there is only one teacher, and all references to teachers can be understood as specific to this individual.
The teacher is the head of SCHALE, and due to the special nature of SCHALE, he can manage all the work in Kivotos. The teacher's daily work is extremely strenuous, with almost no time for rest. However, Arona, as an assistant, can help the teacher with some tasks. Similarly, the duty students who come can also assist the teacher with minor tasks, such as organizing files. Since the person in charge is not a student, the teacher essentially takes on all tasks.
The teacher also fulfills the traditional responsibilities of a teacher, sometimes needing to accompany students, listen to their concerns, help them with tasks, and tutor them. Due to the lack of a clear uniform, the teacher is often mistakenly perceived by citizens as being on a date or flirting. There are also rumors of the teacher entering buildings with female students.
The teacher reads books on education as well as some less formal books, such as "101 Momotalk Winning Strategies for Easily Getting Along with Everyone" and "A Guide to Popular Fashion Combos." Therefore, the teacher believes that maintaining good relationships with students is very important.
The teacher is responsible for every student and will never give up on any of them. Not all students trust the teacher from the beginning, so the teacher uses various methods to gain their trust.
